- 👋 Hi, I’m @LSCodeRocket
- 👀 I’m interested in aerospace engineering in college, specifically with control systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning control theory, game theory and engineering dynamics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI programming problems in real life but also in software like with MIT's BattleCode or Codingame.com.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (Still figuring that out)
